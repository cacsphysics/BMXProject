The separation_times_by_shot.csv is a manual estimation of the time of flight method. The csv file has a header that contains is organized by probe number.

57dt1 == average time delay between positions 5 and 7 (microseconds)
57v1 == average velocity between positions 5 and 7. (km/s)

Note the average velocity is computed as v = sep/(average time delay) and not sum(velocities)/5. The raw data is contained in a notebook, that I may have. I do not believe the error will be significant.
Also, there were 5 features which I used to average the time delay, I do not recall if I (Carlos Cartagena-Sanchez) did the visual inspection or if Josh Carlson did.
